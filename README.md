> **Stop guessing your rate. Calculate your *Real Hourly Rate* with AI.**

## 📖 Overview

The **Freelance Profit Engine (FPE)** is a full-stack financial intelligence dashboard designed to expose the hidden costs of freelancing. Unlike traditional invoicing tools, FPE factors in "friction" (unpaid administrative work) and uses **Machine Learning** to forecast future workload trends.

It syncs a **React Native** mobile client with a secure **Python/Flask** backend, giving you a true picture of your profitability in real-time.

## ✨ Key Features

* **💸 Real-Time Profit Calculation:** Instantly computes your 'True Hourly Rate' by subtracting unpaid hours.
* **📉 Friction Score Analysis:** Visualizes the ratio of Billable Work vs. Unpaid Admin Work.
* **🤖 Predictive Analytics:** Uses Linear Regression (Scikit-Learn) to forecast task duration based on history.
* **📝 Smart Edit History:** Full audit trail allowing you to correct past logs without data loss.
* **👻 Smart Onboarding:** Interactive 'Ghost' states guide new users through their first entry.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

| Component | Tech Stack | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React Native (Expo) | iOS/Android mobile dashboard |
| **Backend** | Python (Flask) | Secure REST API Server |
| **Database** | SQLite | ACID-compliant local storage |
| **ETL** | Pandas | Data cleaning and transformation pipelines |
| **ML Engine** | Scikit-Learn | Linear Regression for forecasting |
| **Auth** | JWT | JSON Web Token authentication |

## ⚙️ System Logic Flow

1.  **User Action:** You update a log in the mobile app.
2.  **Secure Request:** App sends a POST request (w/ JWT) to the Flask backend.
3.  **Data Commit:** Server executes an ACID-compliant SQL UPDATE.
4.  **ETL Trigger:** Pandas triggers a re-calculation pipeline for aggregate metrics.
5.  **AI Retraining:** Scikit-Learn retrains the model on the new dataset.
6.  **Live Update:** App receives the new JSON payload and re-renders charts instantly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js & npm
* Python 3.8+
* Expo CLI

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yashvinjasani/freelancers-profit-tool.git](https://github.com/yashvinjasani/freelancers-profit-tool.git)
cd freelancers-profit-tool
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder and install Python dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python app.py
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and start the Expo app.
